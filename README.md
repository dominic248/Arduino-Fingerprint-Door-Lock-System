# Arduino-Fingerprint-Door-Lock-System
Automate lights in house via door lock system. If the fingerprint id matches, while entering the house the lights are turned on and if fingerprint id matches while locking and unlocking the door inside the house the lights are still kept on and when the fingerprint id matches when the user locks the door while leaving the house, then the lights are turned off automatically.
